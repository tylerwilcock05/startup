### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wondered how you could improve your typing skills in a fun, simplistic way? That's exactly what Typing Test does for you! You can choose between a 15 and 30 second typing test, see your best and average scores, add friends and see their scores, and see the global leaderboard. Aim to be the fastest typer in the world! Within no time at all, you'll see a huge improvement in your typing speed and accuracy.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Provides the structure of the website (text, links, images, several pages, etc...)
- **CSS** - Provides the styling of the page as well as the cursor that will move as you type
- **React** - Provides login and the interactivity (typing keys, pushing buttons, etc...)
- **Service** - Endpoints for authentication, storing/retrieving scores.
- **DB/Login** - Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Also used to store scores and high scores
- **WebSocket** - Users are notified of friend requests and are notified if their friend broke their high score or if a global high score was broken
